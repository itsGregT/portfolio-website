				<p>Hello! My name is Greg Thomas and I am a front end web developer living in Palos Hills, Illinois. I moved from Rochelle, Illinois to the Chicagoland area in 2009 to attend school for Game Art & Design. After graduating I worked as a graphic designer for three years and currently work as a Front End Developer for Dealer eProcess. In my free time you can find me fueling up on caffeine and learning about the newest trends in web development, playing games, watching movies, or editing videos.</p>
				<p>Since 2009, I have obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Game Art & Design from Westwood College and a Web Technician Certificate from the College of DuPage.</p>
				<p>My favorite thing about web development is that I will never run out of things to discover and learn.</p>
